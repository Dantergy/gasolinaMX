# gasolinaMX
**gasolinaMX** is a Project where you could get the information about the locations and prices of gas stations in Mexico.

## How to use it?
Let's start with getting the information, for that you need to have Python 3.8 installed on your computer.
- Create a virtual environment in backend/scraper:
##`python3 -m venv env`

- Activate the virtual environment:
##`.\env\Scripts\activate`

- Install the following libraries:
##`pip install beautifulsoup4`
##`pip install requests`
##`pip install selenium`
##`pip install lxml`
##`pip install pymongo[srv]`

Once all the previous has been installed, launch scraper.py:
##`py scraper.py`

Wait until the scraping finishes its process, and you will get all the information!
